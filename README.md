# 🍫 NeverHungry - A Minecraft Mod

**NeverHungry** is a fun and flavorful Minecraft mod that adds a tasty twist to your survival experience!

## 🥢 What Does It Do?

Adds **Pocky** to your game, which gives special effects upon consumption. Each Pocky has slightly different effects depending on the taste and sugar content of the Pocky.

Currently, I only have Pocky added, but I plan to add **many more foods** in the future — so stay tuned for delicious updates!

## 📦 Food Items

- Chocolate Pocky  
- Chocolate Pocky with 24k Gold Leaf  
- Chocolate Pocky with Blueberry Filling  
- Chocolate Pocky with White Breadstick (sweeter variant)  
- Chocolate Pocky with Cookies & Cream Breadstick  
- Hot Chocolate  

🔮 More foods coming soon...
