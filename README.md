🍫 NeverHungry - A Minecraft Mod

NeverHungry is a fun and flavorful Minecraft mod that adds a tasty twist to your survival experience!

🥢 What Does It Do?

Adds Pocky to your game, which gives special effects upon consumption. Each Pocky has slightly different effects depending on the taste and sugar content of the Pocky.

Currently, I only have Pocky added, but I plan to add many more foods in the future — so stay tuned for delicious updates!
